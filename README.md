Using R for data analysis: Biodiesel Project
A sensitivity analysis for the distillation column was performed with the following variable: Total Molar Flow rate, Feed Temperature, and Column Reflux ratio.
After the sensitivity analysis was conducted, R algorithms were developed to visualize the correlation between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Then the data was fitted to two regression models, RSM and MARS. This allowed for the determination of the optimal condition for maximizing the glycerol molar fraction.
